				<h3>Gaming</h3>
					<p>
						I love games that require me to strategize and really understand the
						mechanics in order to succeed. I started off with the Pokemon series on
						the original GameBoy, and eventually picked up the more strategic 
						Fire Emblem series as I moved to the GameBoy Advanced. In Jr. High I 
						got an Xbox and played all kinds of games. For the past few Years 
						I've been loving League of Legends, but lately the gatcha games on 
						mobile like Fire Emblem Heroes, Summoners War, and Epic Seven have 
						caught my eye (<abbr title="free to play">F2P</abbr> btw). 
					</p>
					</br>
					
				<h3>Eating</h3>
					<p>
						You wouldn't know it just by looking at me, but I LOVE to eat!
						Whether it's homemade cooking, or an all you can eat buffet, I
						always finish what's on my plate; and don't be fooled by my appearence,
						I can eat a hefty serving (or two, or three). My favorite foods
						are donuts and ice cream, but I like all sweets and honestly I'll
						eat just about any kind of food *drools over plate of sushi*.
					</p>
					</br>
					
				<h3>Anime</h3>
					<p>
						It all started with The Seven Deadly Sins. After watching that 
						I had to have more, so I picked up Attack on Titan and it just 
						sealed the deal. I cant even begin to pick a favorite anime, 
						but a couple in the running would be:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>The Seven Deadly Sins</li>
						<li>Attack on Titan</li>
						<li>One Punch Man</li>
						<li>Castlevania</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						I'm one of those anime fans that prefers dubs over subs *GASP*. 
						I have my reasons for liking dubs, but I will certainly tolerate 
						subs. Unpopular opinion: subs are not better than dubs, and dubs
						are not better than subs. Yes, I know that a lot of enthusiasts 
						will tear me to shreds over this, but the truth is, it's 
						everyone's own opinion.
					</p>
					</br>
					
				<h3>The <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> (go Iron Man)</h3>
					<p>
						I've been following the MCU ever since the beginning, the first 
						Iron Man. He is my favorite hero of all the Avengers and he 
						always will be, even after he died in Endgame, and even after 
						<abbr title="Robert Downy Jr.">RDJ</abbr> is no longer with us. 
						The only movie I haven't seen is the original Captain America.
						Despite popular belief, the percieved plot-hole of old man 
						Cap in Avengers Endgame is indeed NOT a plot-hole at all, and I 
						have faith in Marvel to explain any smaller plot-holes in the 
						MCU's future installments, but until then, I'll be morning the 
						death of a great hero );.
					</p>
					</br>
					
				<h3>Coding games</h3>
					<p>
						I've been gaming for as long as I can remember, and for most 
						of my life I've considered myself a hardcore gamer. All 
						this game-time has given me a lot experience with what works 
						in games and what doesn't, and of course, what I like in 
						games and what I don't like. Needless to say I've had my own 
						game ideas over the years ranging from interesting mechanics to 
						story ideas, and I'd love to try them out some day in an 
						enviroment where I can get feedback and improvements upon 
						my ideas. But more than anything I've always wanted to make 
						a game with the classic chess-like mechanics of Fire Emblem.
					</p>
					</br>
					
				<h3>Animals</h3>
					<p>
						I love pretty much all animals, but my favorite are the ones 
						that I can have as pets.
					</p>
					
					<h5>Dogs and Cats</h5>
						<p>
							I currently own a 60lb Yellow-Lab-Chow mix, and hes very 
							fluffy! He was 8 years old when I adopted him in February 
							of 2018, because old dogs need love too and he was exactly 
							what I wanted. Before him, I had a Schipperke 
							mix who was our family dog, but I commandeered him when 
							my mom moved out of state and there was nobody left in 
							the house to take him. My dad also has a cat, and way 
							back in the day he also had a Chocolate-Lab.
						</p>
						
					<h5>Fishkeeping</h5>
						<p>
							One of my roommates in college had a 55g fish tank with some 
							Electric Blue Acara's. At first I didn't care much for them, 
							until I found myself staring at them for minutes at a time while 
							doing homework late at night. They were so elegant and smart 
							(for fish lol) and they just seemed to hover in place without 
							any effort at all. I was hooked, no pun intended, and I picked 
							up a 75g tank at the thrift store for pennies on the dollar. 
							Since I was a college student, I didn't have a lot of money to 
							spend on supplies, and I ended up making most of my equipment 
							which was as fun an endeavor as having the fish was.
