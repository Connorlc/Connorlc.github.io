      <h1>How do I Unwind?</h1>
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <h3>Gaming</h3>
      <p>
        I love games that require me to strategize and really understand the
        mechanics in order to succeed. I started off with the Pokemon series on
        the original GameBoy, and eventually picked up the more strategic 
        Fire Emblem series as I moved to the GameBoy Advanced. In Jr. High I 
        got an Xbox and played all kinds of games. For the past few Years 
        I've been loving League of Legends, but lately the gatcha games on 
        mobile like Fire Emblem Heroes, Summoners War, and Epic Seven have 
        caught my eye (<abbr title="free to play">F2P</abbr> btw).

      </br>
      </br>
      
      <h3>Food</h3>
      <p>
        You wouldn't know it just by looking at me, but I LOVE to eat!
        Whether it's homemade cooking, or an all you can eat buffet, I
        always finish what's on my plate; and don't be fooled by my appearence,
        I can eat a hefty serving (or two, or three). My favorite foods
        are donuts and ice cream, but I like all sweets and honestly I'll
        eat just about any kind of food *drools over plate of sushi*.
      </p>
      </br>
      </br>
      
      <h3>Anime</h3>
      <p>
        It all started with The Seven Deadly Sins. After watching that I had 
        to have more, so I picked up Attack on Titan and it just sealed the 
        deal. I can't even begin to pick a favorite anime, but a couple in 
        the running would be:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The Seven Deadly Sins</li>
        <li>Attack on Titan</li>
        <li>One Punch Man</li>
        <li>Castlevania</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        I prefer dubs over subs *GASP*. I have my reasons for liking dubs, 
        but I'll tolerate subs if I don't want to wait for the dubbed version, 
        or if someone I'm watching with won't watch dubs. Unpopular opinion: 
        subs are not better than dubs, and dubs are not better than subs. I 
        know some enthusiasts will tear me to shreds over this, but the truth 
        is, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
      </p>
      </br>
      </br>
      
      <h3>The <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr></h3>
      <p>
        I've been following the MCU ever since the beginning, the first Iron 
        Man. He is my favorite hero of all the Avengers and he always will 
        be, even after dying in Endgame. The only movie I haven't seen is 
        the original Captain America. Despite popular belief, the percieved 
        plot-hole of old man Cap in Avengers Endgame is indeed NOT a plot-hole 
        at all, and I have faith in Marvel to explain any smaller plot-holes 
        in the MCU's future installments, but until then, I'll be mourning 
        the death of a great hero.
      </p>
      </br>
      </br>
      
      <h3>Game Design</h3>
      <p>
        I've been gaming for as long as I can remember, and for most 
        of my life I've considered myself a hardcore gamer. All 
        this game-time has given me a lot experience with what works 
        in games and what doesn't, and of course, what I like in 
        games and what I don't like. Needless to say I've had my own 
        game ideas over the years ranging from interesting mechanics to 
        story ideas, and I'd love to try them out some day in an 
        enviroment where I can get feedback and improvements upon 
        my ideas. But more than anything I've always wanted to make 
        a game with the classic chess-like mechanics of Fire Emblem.
      </p>
      </br>

      <h3>Animals</h3>
      <p>
        I love pretty much all animals, but my favorite are the ones 
        that I can have as pets.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Dogs and Cats</h5>
      <p>
        I currently own a 60lb Yellow-Lab-Chow mix, and hes very fluffy! He 
        was 8 years old when I adopted him in February of 2018, because old 
        dogs need love too and he was exactly what I wanted. Before him, I had 
        a Schipperke mix who was our family dog, but I commandeered him when 
        my mom moved out of state and there was nobody left in the house to 
        take him. My dad also has a cat, and way back in the day he also had 
        a Chocolate-Lab.
      </p>
        
      <h5>Fishkeeping</h5>
      <p>
        One of my roommates in college had a 55g fish tank with some 
        Electric Blue Acara's. At first I didn't care much for them, 
        until I found myself staring at them for minutes at a time while 
        doing homework late at night. They were so elegant and smart 
        (for fish lol) and they just seemed to hover in place without 
        any effort at all. I was hooked, no pun intended, and I picked 
        up a 75g tank at the thrift store for pennies on the dollar. 
        Since I was a college student, I didn't have a lot of money to 
        spend on supplies, and I ended up making most of my equipment 
        which was as fun an endeavor as having the fish was.
