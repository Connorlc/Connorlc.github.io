				<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
					<h3 id="gaming">Gaming</h3>
						<p>
							I love games that require me to strategize and really understand the
							mechanics in order to succeed. I started off with the Pokemon series on
							the original GameBoy, and eventually picked up the more strategic 
							Fire Emblem series as I moved to the GameBoy Advanced. In Jr. High I 
							got an Xbox and played all kinds of games. For the past few Years 
							I've been loving League of Legends, but lately the gatcha games on 
							mobile like Fire Emblem Heroes, Summoners War, and Epic Seven have 
							caught my eye (<abbr title="free to play">F2P</abbr> btw). 
						</p>
						</br>
						
					<h3 id="eating">Eating</h3>
						<p>
							You wouldn't know it just by looking at me, but I LOVE to eat!
							Whether it's homemade cooking, or an all you can eat buffet, I
							always finish what's on my plate; and don't be fooled by my appearence,
							I can eat a hefty serving (or two, or three). My favorite foods
							are donuts and ice cream, but I like all sweets and honestly I'll
							eat just about any kind of food *drools over plate of sushi*.
						</p>
						</br>
						
					<h3 id="anime">Anime</h3>
						<p>
							It all started with The Seven Deadly Sins. After watching that 
							I had to have more, so I picked up Attack on Titan and it just 
							sealed the deal. I cant even begin to pick a favorite anime, 
							but a couple in the running would be:
						</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>The Seven Deadly Sins</li>
							<li>Attack on Titan</li>
							<li>One Punch Man</li>
							<li>Castlevania</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>
							I'm one of those anime fans that prefers dubs over subs *GASP*. 
							I have my reasons for liking dubs, but I will certainly tolerate 
							subs. Unpopular opinion: subs are not better than dubs, and dubs
							are not better than subs. I know that a lot of enthusiasts 
							will tear me to shreds over this, but the truth is, beauty is 
							in the eye of the beholder.
						</p>
						</br>
						
					<h3 id="mcu">The <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> (go Iron Man)</h3>
						<p>
							I've been following the MCU ever since the beginning, the first 
							Iron Man. He is my favorite hero of all the Avengers and he 
							always will be, even after he died in Endgame, and even after 
							<abbr title="Robert Downy Jr.">RDJ</abbr> is no longer with us. 
							The only movie I haven't seen is the original Captain America.
							Despite popular belief, the percieved plot-hole of old man 
							Cap in Avengers Endgame is indeed NOT a plot-hole at all, and I 
							have faith in Marvel to explain any smaller plot-holes in the 
							MCU's future installments, but until then, I'll be morning the 
							death of a great hero.
						</p>
						</br>
						
					<h3 id="gamedesign">Game Design</h3>
						<p>
							I've been gaming for as long as I can remember, and for most 
							of my life I've considered myself a hardcore gamer. All 
							this game-time has given me a lot experience with what works 
							in games and what doesn't, and of course, what I like in 
							games and what I don't like. Needless to say I've had my own 
							game ideas over the years ranging from interesting mechanics to 
							story ideas, and I'd love to try them out some day in an 
							enviroment where I can get feedback and improvements upon 
							my ideas. But more than anything I've always wanted to make 
							a game with the classic chess-like mechanics of Fire Emblem.
						</p>
						</br>
						
					<h3 id="animals">Animals</h3>
						<p>
							I love pretty much all animals, but my favorite are the ones 
							that I can have as pets.
						</p>
						
						<h5>Dogs and Cats</h5>
							<p>
								I currently own a 60lb Yellow-Lab-Chow mix, and hes very 
								fluffy! He was 8 years old when I adopted him in February 
								of 2018, because old dogs need love too and he was exactly 
								what I wanted. Before him, I had a Schipperke 
								mix who was our family dog, but I commandeered him when 
								my mom moved out of state and there was nobody left in 
								the house to take him. My dad also has a cat, and way 
								back in the day he also had a Chocolate-Lab.
							</p>
							
						<h5>Fishkeeping</h5>
							<p>
								One of my roommates in college had a 55g fish tank with some 
								Electric Blue Acara's. At first I didn't care much for them, 
								until I found myself staring at them for minutes at a time while 
								doing homework late at night. They were so elegant and smart 
								(for fish lol) and they just seemed to hover in place without 
								any effort at all. I was hooked, no pun intended, and I picked 
								up a 75g tank at the thrift store for pennies on the dollar. 
								Since I was a college student, I didn't have a lot of money to 
								spend on supplies, and I ended up making most of my equipment 
								which was as fun an endeavor as having the fish was.
